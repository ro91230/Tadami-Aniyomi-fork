# Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Friendly & Approachable:** Documentation and user-facing text should be warm, clear, and easy to understand. Avoid overly technical jargon when communicating with users.
- **User-Centric Evolution:** Frame updates and features as community-driven improvements on a solid foundation, emphasizing that Tadami evolves based on user needs.

## Visual Identity (Aurora Theme)
- **Material Design 3 (M3) Foundation:** Adhere to M3 principles like dynamic color and rounded corners as the structural base.
- **Aurora Palette & Effects:** Enhance the M3 base with specific Aurora refinements, including gradients, translucency (subtle glassmorphism), and soft lighting effects to create depth and immersion.
- **High-Density Information:** Optimize screen real estate to provide significant information while maintaining visual clarity. Balance aesthetics with functional density.

## User Experience (UX) Design
- **Focused Experience:**
    - **Gestural Control:** Prioritize swipes and intuitive gestures over an abundance of buttons to keep the interface clean and immersive.
    - **Progressive Disclosure:** Present high-level information first, allowing users to dive deeper into details only when needed. This reduces cognitive load and maintains focus.

## Accessibility
- **Inclusive Design:** Ensure the Aurora theme remains usable for everyone.
- **Target Sizes:** Maintain comfortable and large tap targets for all interactive elements to accommodate different dexterity levels.
- **Semantic UI:** Ensure custom components are correctly labeled for screen readers and follow logical focus orders.
